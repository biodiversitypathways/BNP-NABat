  abstract = {The purpose of the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) is to create a continent-wide program to monitor bats at local to rangewide scales that will provide reliable data to promote effective conservation decisionmaking and the long-term viability of bat populations across the continent. This is an international, multiagency program. Four approaches will be used to gather monitoring data to assess changes in bat distributions and abundances: winter hibernaculum counts, maternity colony counts, mobile acoustic surveys along road transects, and acoustic surveys at stationary points. These monitoring approaches are described along with methods for identifying species recorded by acoustic detectors. Other chapters describe the sampling design, the database management system (Bat Population Database), and statistical approaches that can be used to analyze data collected through this program.},

  abstract = {The bat fauna of northwestern Canada remains poorly known, principally due to a lack of dedicated surveys across this vast region. To better assess the diversity of bats in the region, we compiled records from several acoustic survey projects and capture sessions whose purpose was to inventory bats in Yukon and northwestern British Columbia (BC) from 2013 to 2018. During our surveys we obtained the 1st apparent acoustic records for Yuma Myotis (M. yumanensis), Californian Myotis (M. californicus), Long-eared Myotis (M. evotis), Silver-haired Bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and Eastern Red Bat (Lasiurus borealis) from this region. We also captured 2 Long-eared Myotis in northwestern BC. Additionally, our surveys provided range extensions of Northern Myotis (M. septentrionalis), Long-legged Myotis (M. volans), and Hoary Bat (Lasiurus cinereus). Finally, by deploying bat detectors in late fall, and in some cases throughout the winter, we provide data about seasonal patterns for bat activity in some locations, revealing that bats in northwestern BC may be active as late as 29 October and emerge as early as 30 March, a pattern similar to that observed in southern BC. By combining data from several disparate surveys, conducted for different reasons by different researchers, we were able to provide a fuller picture of the bat fauna of this vast region. Our data provides further evidence that the bat fauna of northwestern Canada is richer than previously documented.},
