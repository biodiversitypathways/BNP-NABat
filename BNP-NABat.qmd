# Executive Summary

Banff National Park conducts annual acoustic monitoring of bats as part of the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat). In 2024, the monitoring consisted of `` `r length(site_dates$Site)` `` stationary acoustic deployments operating between `` `r site_dates$earliest_date[1]` `` and `` `r site_dates$latest_date[1]` ``, and `` `r transect_dates$total_transects` `` mobile transects conducted on the nights of `` `r transect_dates$earliest_date` ``and `` `r transect_dates$latest_date` ``. These data were submitted SENSR for processing and manual vetting. The processing focused on seven bat species known to inhabit the region.

In total `` `r length(site_dates$Site)` `` stationary detectors operated for a total of `` `r sum(site_dates$total_days)` `` recorder nights and in total collected `` `r length(data$Site[data$Site != "BANFF-MOBILE"])` ``files. Of these, `` `r length(data$Site[data$Site != "BANFF-MOBILE" & data$MANUAL.ID !=""])` `` were manually reviewed and vetted. Mobile transect surveys collected `` `r length(data$Site[data$Site == "BANFF-MOBILE"])` `` files, of which `` `r length(data$Site[data$Site == "BANFF-MOBILE" & data$AUTO.ID == "Noise"])` ``were identified as noise by the auto id softwares and were not all manually vetted. The species most recorded and identified was Little Brown Bats (*Myotis lucifugus*) with a total of`` `r summary_table[6,6]` `` recordings manually verified.

Key recommendations for the future include modifying the mobile transect route to prevent switchbacks, which compromises abundance measurements, and adjusting the Golf Course and Fenlands sites to be 5-10m away from open water to prevent multiple bats in a single recording.

# Introduction

## Overview of NABat and the NNW Bat Hub

The North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) is a large-scale coordinated effort to monitor bat species across North America using standardized protocols and a unified sample design [@loeb2015Plan]. NABat was established to address the gaps in knowledge and lack of long-term studies of bat species across Mexico, USA, and Canada. The program is administered by the US Geological Survey (USGS), coordinated by the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative (CWHC) in Canada, and implemented by the North by Northwest Bat (NNW) Hub in British Columbia, Alberta, and S.E. Alaska.

As part of contributing to the NABat program, Banff National Park has monitored one sampling cell (GRTSID: 148842) within the park since 2020. This monitoring has occurred using three stationary acoustic detectors and a driving transect.

## 2024 NABat Monitoring in Banff National Park

In the field season of 2024, `` `r length(site_dates$Site)` ``separate stationary bat acoustic deployments and `` `r transect_dates$total_transects` `` mobile transects were made in Banff National Park (@fig-map). The stationary monitoring recorders collected data between `` `r site_dates$earliest_date[1]` `` and `` `r site_dates$latest_date[1]` `` , mobile transects were made on the nights of `` `r transect_dates$earliest_date` ``and `` `r transect_dates$latest_date` `` . The recordings were submitted to [SENSR](https://sensr.ca/) for processing and manual vetting to determine species presence or absence at the sites.

The map shows the three stationary acoustic monitoring sites (red dots) and the mobile driving transect (green line) which was conducted twice between during the sampling period. The blue dashed line represents the NABat grid cell boundary.](Figures/2024Sites.jpg){#fig-map}

# Methods

Full-spectrum recordings from the sampling periods were collected and processed using two automatic classifiers: Kaleidoscope's Bats of North America 5.4.0 classifier and Sonobat 3.0's Northwestern British Columbia classifier. Based on documented species ranges and prior detection data [@olsonBat], manual identification efforts focused on seven species: Big Brown Bats (*Eptesicus fuscus*), Eastern Red Bats (*Lasiurus borealis*), Silver-haired Bats (*Lasionycteris noctivagans*), Hoary Bat (*Lasiurus cinereus*), Little Brown Bats (*Myotis lucifugus*), Long-legged Myotis (*Myotis volans*) and Long-eared Myotis (*Myotis evotis*).

The analysis workflow followed processing standards established by the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) [@reichert2018Guide]. Only recordings that received automated species classifications from either Kaleidoscope or Sonobat were selected for manual verification. For stationary acoustic monitoring sites, recordings were manually vetted until at least one recording per species per site per night was confidently identified. For mobile transects, all recordings with automated classifications underwent complete manual verification. Species identifications were validated using reference call parameters described by @szewczak2018Acoustic, @slough2022New, and @solick2022Bat, in accordance with NABat manual vetting protocols.

# Results

The stationary detectors ran for a total of `r sum(site_dates$total_days)` recorder nights and in total collected `r length(data$Site[data$Site != "BANFF-MOBILE"])` files. Of these, `r length(data$Site[data$Site != "BANFF-MOBILE" & data$AUTO.ID. == "Noise"])` were classified as noise files, with no distinguishable bat present. Of the remaining files, a total of `r length(data$Site[data$Site != "BANFF-MOBILE" & data$MANUAL.ID !=""])` were reviewed and manually vetted, following the minimum standards set by NABat to manually verify recordings until at least one recording per species per site per night was confidently identified [@reichert2018Guide]. The manual ID codes used for species identification follow standard NABat conventions and are detailed in [Appendix A](#sec-appendixa).

For driving transects, a total of `r length(data$Site[data$Site == "BANFF-MOBILE"])` files were collected, of which `r length(data$Site[(data$Site == "BANFF-MOBILE" & data$AUTO.ID. == "Noise")])` were noise files. All files that were not classified as noise were manually verified for the mobile transects.

The most recorded and identified species was Little Brown Bat (*Myotis lucifugus*) with a total of `r summary_table[6,6]` recordings identified, followed by Silver-haired Bats (*Lasionycteris noctivagans*) and Big Brown Bat (*Eptesicus fuscus*) both of which had a total of `r summary_table[1,6]` recordings identified across the sites and transects (@tbl-summarytable).

# Recommendations

## Equipment set up

The current setup has microphones attached directly to the detector (@fig-fen). This creates a flat surface that bounces sound back into the microphone, producing echoes in the recordings (@fig-echo). These echoes reduce recording quality and complicate both automated and manual identification of bat calls. We recommend getting an extension cord so that the microphone can be mounted at the top of the bat pole by itself, while the recorder is at the base. This will reduce the amount of echo recorded improving recording quality.

![Bat monitoring station at Fenlands site demonstrating suboptimal deployment techniques. The detector is positioned over open water, resulting in multiple bat passes recorded in single files. The microphone mounted directly on the recorder creates echo artifacts from the flat surface, compromising both automated and manual identification of bat calls](Figures/20240709_084839.jpg){#fig-fen}

## Site Placement

There was a high number of files with multiple bats recorded in the Golf Course and Fenlands sites (@fig-echo). This is likely due to the proximity to the water at both sites. We recommend moving these sites 5-10m away from open water to minimize the occurrence of multiple bats in single recordings. This change will make species identification more reliable.

![Sample spectrograms demonstrating common recording issues. Top: Multiple bat calls captured in a single file from water-adjacent deployment site. Bottom: Echo artifacts overlapping with bat calls due to microphone placement on flat recorder surface, complicating species identification.](Figures/ProblemRecordings.JPG){#fig-echo}

## Route Design for Transects

The current route contains sections that curve back on themselves (@fig-map). Switchbacks in the route undermines the accuracy of abundance measurements by potentially recording the same bats multiple times. We recommend updating the route to minimize the number of switchbacks, even if this requires the route to go outside of the grid cell being sampled.
