Banff National Park conducts annual acoustic monitoring of bats as part of the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat). In 2024, the monitoring consisted of `3` stationary acoustic deployments operating between `June-26` and `July-09`, and `2` mobile transects conducted on `June-30`and `July-01`. These data were submitted SENSR for processing and manual vetting. The monitoring focused on seven bat species known to inhabit the region: Big Brown Bats (*Eptesicus fuscus*), Eastern Red Bats (*Lasiurus borealis*), Silver-haired Bats (*Lasionycteris noctivagans*), Hoary Bat (*Lasiurus cinereus*), Little Brown Bats (*Myotis lucifugus*), Long-legged Myotis (*Myotis volans*) and Long-eared Myotis (*Myotis evotis*).

In total stationary detectors operated for a total of `42` recorder nights and in total collected `15129`files. Of these, `894` were manually reviewed and vetted. Mobile transect surveys collected `529` files, of which `192`were not identified as noise and were all manually vetted. The species most recorded and identified was Little Brown Bats (*Myotis lucifugus*) with a total of`101` recordings identified.

Key recommendations include modifying the mobile transect route to prevent switchbacks, which compromises abundance measurements, and adjusting the Golf Course and Fenlands sites to be 5-10m away from open water to prevent multiple bats in a single recording.
